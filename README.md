# Scotland Yard AI

This repo provides an implementation of self-play based reinforcement learning based on the 
[AlphaZero paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf). 

Please note: This repo is work in progress. The basic structure of this repo is inspired by this 
[repo](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general). However, the code is adapted such that it can handle the more
general setup of Scotland Yard (i.e. N-player, asymmetric game)
